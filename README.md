Koppeltaal v2.0

The objective of the Koppeltaal foundation includes a limitation for the exchange of data by means of the word 'internal'. This limitation means that data exchange always takes place under the responsibility of one healthcare provider.

Data is exchanged between different type of applications. In Koppeltaal, the term 'application' refers to all forms of ICT systems and eHealth platforms that are relevant for a healthcare provider to exchange data in the context of eHealth activities. The applications are provided by various vendors. These suppliers can unlock their services via Koppeltaal under the responsibility of the healthcare provider.

All FHIR resources of one healthcare provider can be accessed via the Koppeltaal (FHIR Resource) Provider for those service-providing applications that are connected to Koppeltaal. We use common concepts and standards that are based on HL7/FHIR.
