## Overview

The Organization resource describes a formally or informally recognized grouping of people or organizations formed for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action. This includes healthcare providers, departments, community groups, healthcare practice groups, and other organizational entities within the Koppeltaal ecosystem.

This profile is based on the NlcoreHealthcareProviderOrganization profile, inheriting its constraints and adding Koppeltaal-specific requirements.

## Identifier

The `identifier` element is mandatory and should contain at least one identifier for the organization. Common identifiers include:
- AGB-Z (Algemeen GegevensBeheer Zorgverleners) codes
- KvK (Kamer van Koophandel) numbers
- Internal organization identifiers

Example:
```json
{
  "identifier": [{
    "system": "http://fhir.nl/fhir/NamingSystem/agb-z",
    "value": "12345678"
  }]
}
```

## Active

The `active` element is required and indicates whether the organization's record is in active use.

Values:
- `true` - Organization is active
- `false` - Organization is inactive/archived

## Name

The `name` element should contain the official name of the organization as it should be displayed.

## Type

Organization types should follow the nl-core organization type coding when applicable.

## Part Of

When an organization is part of a larger organization (e.g., a department within a hospital), the `partOf` element must reference another KT2_Organization resource.

Example:
```json
{
  "partOf": {
    "reference": "Organization/parent-hospital"
  }
}
```

## Endpoint

When specified, the `endpoint` element must reference KT2_Endpoint resources. This links the organization to its technical endpoints for service delivery.

Example:
```json
{
  "endpoint": [{
    "reference": "Endpoint/org-endpoint-1"
  }]
}
```

## Usage Notes

- Organizations in Koppeltaal represent both healthcare providers and organizational units that manage or provide eHealth services
- The organization hierarchy can be represented using the `partOf` element
- Active status should be maintained to reflect current operational status
