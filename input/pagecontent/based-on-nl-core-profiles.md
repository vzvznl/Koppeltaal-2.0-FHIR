# nl-core profiles

The Dutch National Institute for ICT in Healthcare (Nictiz) defines and maintains Healthcare Information Models (hcim) or Zorginformatiebouwstenen (zibs) in Dutch. These zibs are described in FHIR R4 profiles. More information on these profiles can be found in their Simplifier project: [Nictiz R4 Zib2020](https://simplifier.net/nictiz-r4-zib2020).

Some of the more care related resources used in Koppeltaal 2.0 are based on their national nl-core equivalent (See the Simplifier project for more information).
This promotes reusability and interoperability of the profiles.
